Publications Using Scenic
=========================

Main Papers
-----------

The main paper on Scenic is:

	| :t:`Scenic: A Language for Scenario Specification and Scene Generation`.
	| Fremont, Dreossi, Ghosh, Yue, Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, and Seshia.
	| PLDI 2019. [`full version <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09310>`_]

An expanded version of this paper appears as Chapters 5 and 8 of this thesis:
